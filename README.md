# Mathematical tools

This repository is dedicated to be a didactic reference of mathematical tools that I have used along Ph.D for numeric python code. List of contents:

- Derivative of a matrix
- Statistical distributions, specifying expected values
- Multivariate interpolation with different python functions
- Minimization of a function using iminuit, with an example of a Chi-Square profile and contour plot of parameters from a simple model
